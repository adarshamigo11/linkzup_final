Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Test User",
  "email": "test@example.com"
}
```

### Manual Testing

1. Start your development server
2. Sign up a new user through any method
3. Check the user's email for the welcome message
4. Verify the email content and links work correctly

## Error Handling

- Email failures don't prevent user registration
- All email errors are logged to console
- Users can still access the platform even if welcome email fails

## Customization

To customize the email content, edit `lib/email-utils.ts`:

- Modify the HTML template in `sendWelcomeEmail` function
- Update colors, branding, or content as needed
- Test changes using the test endpoint

### Email Subject

Change the subject line in `sendWelcomeEmail`:

```typescript
subject: "ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to LinkzUp! Your Account is Ready",
```

### Email Sender

Update the sender name and email:

```typescript
from: `"LinkzUp Team" <${process.env.GMAIL_USER}>`,
```

## Production Deployment

For production:

1. **Use Dedicated Email Service**: Consider SendGrid, AWS SES, or Mailgun
2. **Set Up Domain Authentication**: Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
3. **Monitor Delivery Rates**: Track email delivery and bounce rates
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Send test emails to various email providers

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending

1. Check Gmail credentials in environment variables
2. Verify 2-factor authentication is enabled
3. Ensure app password is correct
4. Check console logs for error messages

### Email Going to Spam

1. Set up proper SPF and DKIM records
2. Use a dedicated email service
3. Warm up the email sending reputation
4. Include proper unsubscribe links

### Gmail Quota Limits

- Gmail has daily sending limits (500/day for regular accounts)
- Consider using Gmail Business or dedicated email service for high volume

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- App passwords can be revoked from Google Account settings
- Each app password is specific to the application
- Monitor for any unauthorized email sending
